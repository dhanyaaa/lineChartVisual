# lineChartVisual

Part of a project in which I worked in a group to create multiple interactive visuals to help raise awareness for a cause of our choice. My group chose to do environmenetal sustainability. My part was that of energy consumption. My chart shows various trends and different continents can be selected to be displayed. When hovering over a feature, a breif description of the trend is also shown.
